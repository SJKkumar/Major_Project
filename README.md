# DETECTING PEDOPHILES ON SOCIAL MEDIA USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK
Pedophiles are using social media as a platform to apporach minors with malcious intentions. Many Machine learning algorithms were used to detect 
these kind of people and these algorithms successful, however these algorithm has two major draw back,that is, these algorithms lack accuracy and the scope 
of improvement is low. In this project deep convolutional neural network is employed to achieve the same. The dataset used to train the model contains 
texts and their respective emotions. The model is trained with train dataset and the model is tested with the test dataset. various metrices were alculated during 
the training and testing process.

The proposed system makes use of convolutional neural network which is a deep learning algorithm.
A neural network are comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers,
and an output layer. Convolutional neural networks are distinguished from other neural networks by
their superior performance.

• Get the Dataset (Data)- To create a machine learning model, the first thing we required is a dataset as a
machine learning model completely works on data. The collected data for a particular problem
in a proper format is known as the dataset.
• Importing Libraries- In order to perform data preprocessing using Python, we need to import
some predefined Python libraries. These libraries are used to perform some specific jobs.
• Importing the dataset- Now to import the dataset, we will use read csv() function of pandas
library, which is used to read a csv file and performs various operations on it.
• Data cleaning- In this phase of pre-processing we clean the dataset. Cleaning refers to removal
of unnecessary and unprocessable elements from the text in order to perform NLP and make the
model understand the sentiment of the text to the fullest.
• Handling Missing data- The next step of data preprocessing is to handle missing data in the
datasets. If our dataset contains some missing data, then it may create a huge problem for our
machine learning model. The records with missing data must be either removed or be replaced
with a filler value.
• Splitting the Dataset into the Training set and Test set- In machine learning data preprocessing,
we divide our dataset into a training set and test set. This is one of the crucial steps of data
preprocessing as by doing this, we can enhance the performance of our machine learning model

# Algorithm-
• Step 1- Importing and Preparing the Dataset For training the model.
• Step 2- Assigning Labels and Features
• Step 3- Normalising X and converting labels to categorical data
• Step 4- Split X and Y for use in CNN
• Step 5- Define the layers in the model
• Step 6- Compile and train the CNN model
• Step 7- Calculate Accuracy and Score of the model.
